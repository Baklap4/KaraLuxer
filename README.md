# KaraLuxer

A python script to port songs from [Karaoke Mugen](https://karaokes.moe/en/) to [Vocaluxe](https://www.vocaluxe.org/).

As Karaoke Mugen does not feature pitch mapping, only timings will be generated by the script.

## How to run

To run the script you need [python](https://www.python.org/) (Version 3.6 or newer) and
[ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) must be installed and on your path.

The requirements for the script can be installed using: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

The script can then be run from the terminal, or using the GUI.

## TODO

- ~~Add support for basic automatic pitch detection.~~ (See branch `pitch-detection` but TL;DR pitch detection wasn't really good enough to keep working on.)
- Prevent the closing of the GUI if the script is running.
- Create bundled version.
