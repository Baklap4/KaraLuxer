# KaraLuxer

A python script to port songs from [Karaoke Mugen](https://karaokes.moe/en/) to the [Ultrastar](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/USDX) file format for use with. To perform the inverse use [ultrastar2ass](https://github.com/AxelTerizaki/ultrastar2ass).

As Karaoke Mugen does not feature pitch mapping, only timings will be generated by the script. Pitches can be automatically generated from the mapped file using [Ultrastar Pitch](https://github.com/paradigmn/ultrastar_pitch) (Accuracy will vary per map).

## How to run

### Manual

To run the script you will need Python 3.

Required packages for the script can be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. FFMPEG must be present on the
system for the script to work. You can either place a ffmpeg binary in a subfolder named `tools` or have it accessible
on your PATH.

The script can be used from the command line via `karaluxer.py` or with a GUI via `kl_gui.py` (TODO).

### Compiled Executable

Compiled executables can be found on the [releases](https://github.com/WarwickAnimeSoc/KaraLuxer/releases) page. The
executables only include the GUI.

## TODO

- KaraLuxer
  - Duet support

- KaraLuxer GUI
  - TBD
