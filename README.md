# KaraLuxer

A python script to port songs from [Karaoke Mugen](https://karaokes.moe/en/) to the [Ultrastar](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/USDX) file format for use with [Vocaluxe](https://www.vocaluxe.org/). To perform the inverse use [ultrastar2ass](https://github.com/AxelTerizaki/ultrastar2ass).

As Karaoke Mugen does not feature pitch mapping, only timings will be generated by the script. Pitches can be automatically generated from the mapped file using [Ultrastar Pitch](https://github.com/paradigmn/ultrastar_pitch) (Accuracy will vary per map).
