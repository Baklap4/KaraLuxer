# KaraLuxer

A python script to port songs from [Karaoke Mugen](https://karaokes.moe/en/) to [Vocaluxe](https://www.vocaluxe.org/).

As Karaoke Mugen does not feature pitch mapping, only timings will be generated by the script.

## How to run

To run the script you need [python](https://www.python.org/) (Version 3.6 or newer).

The requirements for the script can be installed using: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

The script can then be run from the terminal.

## TODO

- Add support for basic automatic pitch detection.
- Add support for the [Kara Database](https://kara.moe/), so that the script simply requires a URL as input.
- (Low Priority) Create a GUI / executable version.
